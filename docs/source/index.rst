The Voxpopuli Documentation
===========================

Here's the small yet infinitely useful documentation for voxpopuli. Two paths lay ahead of you:

 * If you just want to do text-to-speech (TTS), go over the installation tutorial and jump straight to the intro.
 * If you want to do a little bit more with voxpopuli (e.g., manipulate phonemes as we call them), you might want to
    look at our introduction to Espeak and Mbrola. It's fairly easy to understand, but it will prevent some
    headscratching and useless google searches.
